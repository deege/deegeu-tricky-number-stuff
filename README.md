# Tricky Java Number Stuff on DeegeU.com

This is the source code for the "[Tricky Java Number Stuff](http://www.deegeu.com/videos/tricky-java-number-stuff/)" video on DeegeU.com.

The purpose of this repository is to supplement the videos with code.

If you’re following along in the "[Free Java Online Course](http://www.deegeu.com/free-java-course-online/)", Tricky Java number stuff is a good topic to hit after we’ve covered primitives and operators. One lesson I tell everyone when they are learning about computers is “Computers do what you tell them to, not what you want them to”. It’s especially true when programming. Too often you’ll say I know what will happen, and you’ll be surprised by the outcome. Once you think about it a bit more, you’ll realize your mistake and say “Oh yeah”. Here’s a few “Oh yeah” moments for you.

This code is written and compiled for Java 8.
